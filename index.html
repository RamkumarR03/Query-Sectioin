                why is the moon sometimes out during the day?&CirclePlus; </summary>
            <p>The Earth's daily revolution on its axis means that the Moon is actually above the horizon for about 12 hours out of every 24. 
                Usually, some portion of that time will be during daylight â€“ you
                 just need to look carefully, because its brightness is so much less than the Sun's.</p>

            <summary>Why is the sky blue?&CirclePlus;</summary>
            <p>The Short Answer:
                Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. 
                Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. 
                This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.</p>

            <summary>Will we ever discover aliens?&CirclePlus;</summary>
            <p>No extraterrestrial life has yet been conclusively detected. Such life might range from simple forms such as prokaryotes to intelligent beings,
                 possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more advanced than the human species.</p>

            <summary>How much does the Earth weigh?&CirclePlus;</summary>
            <p>
                In English
                13,170,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1.3 x 1025) pounds! That's thirteen septillion!Earth weighs about 13,170,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds
                 (or 5,974,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms). Since Earth is too big to be placed on a scale, scientists use mathematics 
                 and the laws of gravity to figure out Earth's weight.</p>

            <summary>How do airplanes stay up?&CirclePlus;</summary>
            <p>Airplane wings are shaped to make air move faster over the top of the wing. When air moves faster, the pressure of the air decreases.
                So the pressure on the top of the wing is less than the pressure on the bottom of the wing. The difference in pressure creates a force on
                 the wing that lifts the wing up into the air.
